# Documentation

This documentation set is split by purpose so the main README can stay focused on discovery, value, and quick onboarding for OpenCode ChatGPT OAuth/Codex workflows.

## Start Here

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md): full install, auth, configuration templates, model selectors, and first-run verification
- [Tools and CLI](tools-and-cli.md): complete catalog of 24 `codex-*` tools and standalone bin commands
- [Architecture Overview](architecture.md): public map of the installer, OpenCode plugin entry, TUI plugin, tool registry, request pipeline, rotation, and storage model
- [Configuration Reference](configuration.md): config keys, environment variables, fallback behavior, and file locations
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md): common failure modes and recovery steps
- [FAQ](faq.md): short answers for common questions
- [Privacy & Data Handling](privacy.md): what is stored locally, what is sent upstream, and how to delete it

## Maintainer and Architecture Docs

- [Architecture](development/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [GitHub Discoverability](development/GITHUB_DISCOVERABILITY.md)
- [Configuration Flow](development/CONFIG_FLOW.md)
- [Configuration Fields](development/CONFIG_FIELDS.md)
- [Testing Guide](development/TESTING.md)
- [TUI Parity Checklist](development/TUI_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md)

## Historical audits

Files under [audits/](audits/INDEX.md) are a **historical** review archive. They are useful for context but are not the source of truth for current package behavior (v6.9.1). Prefer the guides above and `CHANGELOG.md` for live contracts.

## Notes

- The root [README](../README.md) is the landing page and 60-second start.
- Use [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for release history instead of treating the README as a release log.
- The docs in this folder are the canonical public docs surface for the repository.
